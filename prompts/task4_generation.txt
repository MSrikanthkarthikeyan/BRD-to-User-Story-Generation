Based on the provided requirements, synthesized context, and business goals, generate comprehensive user stories that align with industry best practices.

STRUCTURE FOR EACH USER STORY:

1. **Title**: Clear, descriptive title (5-8 words)

2. **User Story**: Maximum 25 words using the format:

5. **Recommended Steps**: 4-6 implementation steps:
   - Concrete, actionable tasks

   - Technical risks
   - Business/operational risks
   - Resource/timeline risks
   - Integration/dependency risks
   - User adoption/change management risks
   
   Format each as:
   - **Risk**: [Description]
   - **Mitigation**: [Strategy to address]

7. **Acceptance Criteria**: 5-8 specific, testable criteria following SMART framework:
   - Written as "Given-When-Then" scenarios OR "The system shall..." statements
   - Measurable and verifiable
   - Cover functional requirements
   - Include edge cases where relevant
   - Address non-functional requirements (performance, security, usability)

- Avoid lengthy, complex paragraphs
- Use heterogeneous paragraph and sentence lengths
- Avoid jargon, buzzwords, and complex artifacts

- Focus on sounding like a human copywriter, not marketing copy
- Avoid introductory phrases and filler words
- No clichés or worn-out phrases
