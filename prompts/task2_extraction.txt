TASK: Requirement Extraction

OBJECTIVE:
Extract and categorize all requirements from the analyzed BRD with full traceability.

RULES:
1. Extract ONLY what is explicitly stated or clearly implied in the BRD
2. Do NOT add new requirements or features
3. Maintain precise BRD source references for traceability
4. Assign confidence levels based on clarity of the requirement
5. Output ONLY valid JSON with no additional text

CONFIDENCE LEVELS:
- High: Explicitly stated with clear details
- Medium: Stated but lacks some details or has minor ambiguity
- Low: Implied or inferred from context

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):
